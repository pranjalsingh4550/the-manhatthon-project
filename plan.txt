all integers are signed long
all floats are double

list instructions in an enum


ujump (unconditional)
cjump
lw (64b)
sw (64b)

ret/retq (?)


alu ops

andbl, orbl, notbl (boolean)
andbw, orbw, notbw, xorbw shrbw, shlbw (bitwise) (sh: shift)
cmpeq, cmpne, cmplt, cmple, cmpgt, cmpge

addi, subi, muli, divi, floori, modi, expi (integer ops)
addf, subf, mulf, divf, floorf, modf, expf (float ops)

i2float
fl2int



operations act on subtrees: semantic actions of the form do_op (subtree $1, subtree $2, destination $$) { ir.push_back(**);}

will we be optimising things?
x86 has instructions to compare, for example, lower 8 bits of so-and-so register. This is a minimal set of instructions.
